# 🌩️ **AWS Labs with Terraform**  
> 🚀 **Automate your AWS deployments with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) - Terraform**

This repository will contain a series of **AWS labs** using **Terraform**. The goal is to create, manage, and automate cloud infrastructures effectively and reproducibly.

### 🌟 **Project Goals**  
- 📂 Provide practical examples of using **AWS** with **Terraform**.  
- 🛠️ Simplify cloud infrastructure automation with **Infrastructure as Code**.

## 📚 **About the Labs**  
Each lab includes practical examples of AWS services such as:

- 🖥️ **Compute**: EC2, Auto Scaling, Lambda  
- 🗂️ **Storage**: S3, EBS, EFS  
- 🌐 **Networking**: VPC, Subnets, Route Tables, Load Balancers  
- 🔐 **Security**: IAM, Security Groups, KMS  
- 🔄 **DevOps**: CloudWatch, CodePipeline, CodeBuild

1. 🛠️ **Terraform** installed (v1.0 or higher).  
2. 🌩️ An active **AWS** account.  
3. 🔑 Necessary **permissions** to provision AWS resources (EC2, S3, IAM, etc.).

## 📜 **Credits** 

This project is inspired by the remarkable work of **Dr. Thyago Mota** & **João Marcelo Uchôa de Alencar** **https://github.com/thyagomota/aws-labs.git**. I use their labs as a reference. Unlike them, who perform manual operations on AWS, I use Terraform to automate these tasks and make them easy to reproduce.
